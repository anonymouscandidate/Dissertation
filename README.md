**Dissertation**

This repository contains all of the functions I used to calculate the acoustic indices in my dissertation.
It also includes the 3 .wav files at each filtering level, associated with each of the spectrograms displayed in Figure 2.
Finally, it contains spectrogram_image.Rmd, the code I used to create each spectrogram.
